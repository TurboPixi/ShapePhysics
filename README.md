## How to Play
At the very start of the game, the player starts at level 1. Inactive neutral shapes will slowly drift down from the sky. These blocks can be activated by hitting them with force cubes, which are generated by either left-clicking or right clicking. A left-click creates a weak cube, and a right-click creates a strong cube. The cubes fire upwards, and are used to activate & juggle neutral shapes.

Knocking any two neutral shapes together will cause them to activate, and fall faster. If the two neutral shapes are the same color, they become positively charged. Positive shapes can be knocked into other neutral shapes of the same color to spread the positive charge. When positive shapes hit the ground, they give you points and restore missing health.

If the shapes are allowed to touch the ground, though, then health is lost and the shapes become negative instead, docking points. Just like positive shapes, if a neutral shape touches a negative shape, the neutral shape will become negative, too!

As you get more points, you'll level up. At first, there will only be one color to manage, but at every 10th level, a new color gets added. More colors to deal with means having to be more careful while trying to match colors!
